* Maildir refilter
maildirrefilter.scm re-applies your sieve rules to mail in a maildir
folder. So, if you have added new rules to your .sieve rule file,
mail that previously got stuck in your inbox, will be moved.

There are other solutions, but this one has the following benefits:
- preserves flags
- mail that does not trigger a rule is completely untouched

The refilter is written in Guile scheme, and assumes the dovecot
sieve implementation.
