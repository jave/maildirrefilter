* Maildir refilter
maildirrefilter.scm re-applies your sieve rules to mail in a maildir
folder. So, if you have added new rules to your .sieve rule file,
mail that previously got stuck in your inbox, will be moved.

There are other solutions, but this one has the following benefits:
- preserves flags
- mail that does not trigger a rule is completely untouched

The refilter is written in Guile scheme, and assumes the dovecot
sieve implementation.

Currently the code is kind of soldered to my configuration, but its
easy enough to change, and if you would like to try it, I can add
configuration options.

[2017-05-27 l√∂r] ive added the ability to run the sieve processes in
parallel. also its possible to use rspamc to classify mails.

the fancy parallell feature requires guile 2.2. If your distro doesn't
have it yet, you can get it with guix.
